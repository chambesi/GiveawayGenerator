# GiveawayGenerator
If the program won't import pyqt6, try these commands:
pip install pyqt6
or
py -m pip install pyqt6

I wrote this program to help me decide how to choose the winner for a giveaway using the random module.

You can enter any number of entries and use special characters like @ and the like!

To add an entry, you can click Add Entry.
To remove an entry, you can click on the entry you want to remove, then click Remove Entry.
To clear the list, you can click on the Clear button to start over.

If you try to enter without adding an entry, a label below the list will display an error.

When you're ready to generate the winner, click the button on the bottom of the window and it will randomly pick a winner.
